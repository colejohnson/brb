##brb (name subject to change)

Web application displaying a full­page notice of where you've r­-u-­n-­o-­f-­t
to.


##Description
Brb is a web application that provides a quick solution to notifying others where you are when you leave your workspace. This is accomplished through the display of a full screen notice comprised of an aesthetically pleasing motion graphic and a single line of editable text. These notices are labeled as tags, and can be quickly accessed through a keyword preceded by a slash at the end of brb's url (i.e. brb.me/coffee) or from a selection of popular tags on the websites main screen. These tags are meant to be purposefully general ranging from "lunch" and "phone call" to a default "be right back". While primarily imagined for an open workplace environment, brb has further uses in school or casual public places.

##Views

Brb mainly consists of two views.The first being the index page. Here the user can find a 2x3 grid of available tags, finding additional tags below the fold. Selection of one tag on the index will dynamically generate the second screen; the notice screen or tag screen. This screen is the showcase for brb's main feature, displaying the full page notice with included cutesy motion graphic.

##Style

I think of brb as a personal tool, it's not professional, it's not flashy. And well, neither are coffee runs and bathroom breaks. It should be playful, uncomplicated, with near invisible design. For the initial user, they should enjoying seeing it, but be able to hop quickly to their end screen. The second user, the one seeing the tag screen, only interacts with the visuals, hopefully cracking a smirk at the sight of a dancing coffee cup

To me, this is where the majority of brb's personality will stem from, the motion graphics playfully reporting where "it's user" ran off to. It's important that brb's design has a cultivated branding, it makes for a more memorable experience. Bespoke graphics with a similar style achieve this. I'll refer back to Dropbox's awesome brand materials (http://byalicelee.com/ is amazing)
quick notes on what I see as guidelines for gifs:
	* short, 3­5 seconds long
	* loop smoothly, no jarring repeats
	* accompanied with specific text and background color

##Release One

The first release of brb will be for Creative Industry Day, and will showcase core functionality, defined styled, and details into future development. There will be six defined tags, with URLs, color schemes, and default taglines.
Motion graphics will be sourced from online artists (credits given in notice screen) and will be conducive to the style and aesthetic of the site. Additional visuals like text and background color will have to be determined for each graphic.

##Release Two

The second release comes with a more flexible deadline, and will include all features listed, and bespoke graphics for each tag. Analytics will be built in to track popular tags. Users will be able to further customize tags. The index page will feature a portal for new tag and motion graphic submissions. Back­end will be implemented for quick new tag adding.

##Unsolved Issues

Keeping the display from falling asleep. Aside from looping a damn flash video in the background.
